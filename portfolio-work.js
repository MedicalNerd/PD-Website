With a nod to yin and yang and a blue color scheme for contrast, the logo, which features headphones and a book face, represents the harmony between reading and music. The green bar gives a contemporary touch and is evocative of Leo 2.0. The portfolio page features transparent pieces centered around a central shape, emulating the design of Scrom parcels. The CV, which draws inspiration from Scrom, emphasizes your advantages to draw in possible backers. To establish your reputation, your about me section features a professional photo along with mentions of your collaborations with well-known authors and performers. The design of the home page, which includes a search bar and a free trial button, is similar to Audible",

The back I used gray as i think it helps dull the background so much to allow the logo and the text  to be highlighted and allow for the audience to focus their attention onto it. Overall my Design is inspired by the more modern design of some namecards and is simple and clean like modern designs in general.",

The colour schemes were chosen to fit the theme of Japan as the background is a gradient of the sakura flower with purple and green helping to contrast against the background to ensure the texts are readable.
